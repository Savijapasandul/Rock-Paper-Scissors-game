# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game
This Python code implements a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a brief description of its functionality:

GUI Setup: The code creates a main window with options for Rock, Paper, and Scissors displayed as buttons with corresponding images.

Game Logic: When a player selects an option, the code generates a random choice for the computer and determines the winner based on the classic rules of the game (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock).

Result Display: After the player's choice is made, the result (win, loss, or tie) is displayed in a label on the GUI.

Game History: The code keeps track of game records, including the player's choice, computer's choice, and the result of each game. There's a button to view the game history, which opens a new window displaying a table with the game records.

User Interaction: The GUI allows users to play the game by clicking on buttons, view the result of each game, and access the game history.
